The World's Worst Video Game Music Trivia Game

Jackbox style game where the game is played on one screen, and everyone else joins with their phones. 

Try and guess the Video Game Series based on the music, but it starts at 1500% Playback Speed, and goes down 50% every loop until someone guesses the game! 

Tthank you to KaBoonio Gaming for the Trivia Video!

(I wanted to embed the video directly but I can't play it any faster then 2x unless it was in MP4 format)


Where is the public server?

Here's a video of the Game Being Played.

Ran out of time trying to get the APP done that I then realized that temporal requires it's own application to be running on the server so it's not as easy to deploy.
